# Jekyll Pack
An improved development and build environment for Jekyll by addition of Gulp and Webpack.

* Live browser reload of changes related to Jekyll (including config files)
* JS asset bundling
* ES6 transpiling
* Extensible platforms for things like hot reloading, transipiling, bundling, distribution, etc
* Vagrant and VM polling fallbacks

## Getting Started
Make sure you have the requirements for Jekyll and Node/NPM ready to go

Simply clone and install NPM dependencies.
Run the NPM script **gulp** to start a local dev server

_Only tested on a Unix based machine (Arch Linux)_

```
npm install
npm run gulp
```
